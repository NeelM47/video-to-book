# 📖 TubeToPage: AI-Powered YouTube-to-eBook Converter

**TubeToPage** is a high-performance Python tool that transforms YouTube videos into polished, professional eBooks. By leveraging state-of-the-art AI models via **Groq**, it synthesizes audio transcripts and YouTube captions into a coherent narrative, formatted specifically for "Bionic Reading."

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Ensemble Synthesis:** Uses **Llama 3.3 70B** to cross-reference YouTube's auto-captions with high-fidelity **Whisper-Large-v3** transcripts, ensuring technical terms and names are 100% accurate.
- **Bionic Reading Support:** Automatically formats text with **Bionic bolding**, significantly increasing reading speed and focus on e-readers.
- **Batch Processing:** Drop multiple URLs into a `links.txt` file and generate an entire library in one go.
- **Polished Prose:** Moves beyond raw transcripts. The AI acts as a scientific editor, removing filler words (uh, um) and rewriting spoken word into high-quality book-style narrative.
- **Security First:** Built to use environment variables for API management, preventing accidental exposure of sensitive keys.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Transcription:** [Groq](https://groq.com/) Whisper-Large-v3
- **Intelligence:** [Groq](https://groq.com/) Llama 3.3 70B
- **Extraction:** `yt-dlp` & `youtube-transcript-api`
- **Output Format:** EPUB (via `ebooklib`)
- **Language:** Python 3.11+

## 🏗️ How it Works

1. **Dual-Stream Retrieval:** The script extracts the official YouTube transcript and simultaneously downloads the audio stream.
2. **AI Transcription:** The audio is sent to Groq's LPUs for near-instant transcription using Whisper.
3. **Ensemble Refinement:** Both transcripts are fed into Llama 3.3. The model identifies discrepancies, fixes stutters, and synthesizes the content into textbook-quality prose.
4. **Bionic Formatting:** The text is processed to bold the "fixation points" of every word.
5. **eBook Assembly:** A structured EPUB is generated with custom CSS for perfect visibility in both light and dark modes.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NeelM47/video-to-book.git
cd video-to-book
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Your API Key
For security, this project uses environment variables. You can set your Groq API key in your terminal:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your_gsk_key_here"
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$env:GROQ_API_KEY="your_gsk_key_here"
```

*Note: If no environment variable is found, the script will securely prompt you for the key at runtime.*

### 4. Run
Add your YouTube links to `links.txt` and execute:
```bash
python main.py
```

## 🛡️ PyTorch 2.6 Fix
This project includes a built-in patch for the recent **PyTorch 2.6** security update (`weights_only=True` changes) that previously broke `whisperx` and `pyannote` models. It uses a custom `patched_load` strategy to ensure model weights and metadata load correctly without compromising the production workflow.

### Updated Code Logic for `main.py`
To make sure the README and the Code match, ensure your `get_groq_client` function looks like this:

```python
def get_groq_client():
    # 1. Try to get the key from the Environment Variable (System)
    api_key = os.environ.get("GROQ_API_KEY")
    
    # 2. If not found, ask the user to type it in (Secure)
    if not api_key:
        print("🔑 Groq API Key not found in environment variables.")
        api_key = input("👉 Enter your Groq API Key: ").strip()
        
    if not api_key:
        raise ValueError("A Groq API Key is required to run this program.")
        
    return Groq(api_key=api_key)
```
